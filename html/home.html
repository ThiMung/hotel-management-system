                <h5>NMT Hotel History</h5>
                <p>
                    Built in 1898, the red-brick building that now houses NMT Hotel began its life as a riverside
                    warehouse
                    along the East River, where sailors unloaded crates of coffee, spices, and textiles from ships bound
                    for
                    the growing city. Back then, the district was a maze of cobblestone streets and iron bridges, alive
                    with
                    the rhythm of trade and the clatter of wooden carts echoing through narrow lanes.
                    For decades, the building stood as a witness to change — from steamships to skyscrapers, from
                    handwritten ledgers to electric lights. But as the harbor grew quieter and industries moved away,
                    its
                    heavy doors closed for good. Dust gathered on the beams, ivy crept up the walls, and the city’s
                    noise
                    faded into a distant hum. The warehouse became a ghost of its own time, waiting for a new story.
                    In 2011, a young architect stumbled upon the forgotten structure during a morning walk. Captivated
                    by
                    the texture of its bricks and the quiet dignity of decay, she decided to bring it back to life — not
                    as
                    another polished tower, but as a place where the city could remember how to breathe. Over two years
                    of
                    careful restoration, every window was mended by hand, every steel beam polished but not hidden. The
                    goal
                    was not perfection, but preservation.
